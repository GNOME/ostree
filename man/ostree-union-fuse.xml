        <para>
          It allows the files of different commits to form a single
          file system.
          Each specified layer shadows the previous one, so that only
          the newer version of a file is accessible.
          If the option <option>-o whiteouts</option> is specified,
          files that have the form <literal>.wh.NAME</literal> are
          treated as whiteouts.  A whiteout file is used to remove a
          file which is present in a previous layer.

          ostree-union-fuse is an inspection tool for a transient
          mount and it is not a replacement for checkout --union.

          If<option>-o memcache</option> is used ostree-union-fuse might
          use additional memory to cache the results.
